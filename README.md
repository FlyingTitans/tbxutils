Term Base exchange (TBX) Utilities

Term Base eXchange is the open, XML based standard for
exchanging structured terminological data. TBX was
submitted to the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) on February 21, 2007, for adoption
as an ISO standard. It is now being worked on within an
ISO context (as ISO DIS 30042) and it is anticipated
that it will be accepted by ISO Technical Committee 37
as a draft international standard (DIS) in Q2 2008.
The version submitted to ISO is available on-line in
XHTML format.
