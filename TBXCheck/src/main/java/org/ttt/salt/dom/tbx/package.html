This is a customized Document Object Model (DOM) system for the TBX file.</p>
<p>
The javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder was used at first to create the DOM, but
it was found that more information was needed for well-formed and validation
errors. Therefore this was built to create a custom TBX DOM document tree.</p>
<p>
This will also allow the TBX file to be built and validated on a termEntry by
termEntry basis, and then the termEntry may be disposed of to allow the
operational footprint to be small.</p>
