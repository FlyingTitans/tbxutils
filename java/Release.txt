Release Processes

This describes the full release process for all TBX Utilities. This is
mainly so the original developer could forget how to do it and not need
to worry about relearning the process.

ENVIRONMENT
The //project/scm/connection element is the read/write repository
location.

PROCESS
1. Make sure all code has been pulled into the public repository.

2. Do a dry run release build to make sure everything will build
correctly. Before doing the deploy and site-deploy change the repository
tags to a local location in pom.xml—this will be eliminated when the
release is cleaned.
    mvn release:prepare -DdryRun
    mvn clean
    mvn site
    mvn deploy
    mvn site-deploy
    mvn release:clean

3. Fix any problems in the dry run and push to the public repository.

4. Do the release.
    mvn release:prepare
    mvn release:stage
