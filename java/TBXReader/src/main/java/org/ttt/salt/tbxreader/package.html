		TBXReader is meant to be used in reading TBX and XCS files, and
		will handle the associated parsing, validation, and conformance
		checking of those files.
		<p>
		TBXReader may be used with various design patterns for maximum
		flexibility in integrating the package within your system. It can
		build objects for use with the observer or iterator design patterns.
		It can deliver a W3C DOM Document that may be changed with XCS
		conformance being performed before a change to the document is
		allowed.</p>
		<p>
		TBXReader is designed to handle small to very large, greater than
		4 GiB, TBX filesâ€”through the use of the {@link TBXObserver} and
		{@link TBXIterator} objects.</p>
		
		<h2>Design Patterns</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<strong>Observer:</strong> Use the {@link TBXObserver} to implement
			the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer</a>
			design pattern.</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Iterator:</strong> Use the {@link TBXIterator} to implement
			the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern">Iterator</a>
			design pattern.</li>
		</ul>
